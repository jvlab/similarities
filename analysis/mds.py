"""
To improve ordinary Nelder-Mead minimization, I can initialize the minimization with coordinates returned by
metric multidimensional scaling (MDS). This file is to test if this alternate seeding can help.

To get coordinates from MDS, I first need a distance matrix. The simulated judgments do not directly provide pairwise
distances. Instead they provide data on comparisons of pairs of pairs of stimuli - all we know is if one distance is
larger than another. We do not know the magnitude of any distance.

We can work around this by using a heuristic as follows.
Let d(i, j) be (a + 1)/ (a + b + 2), where
a is the number of times d(i, j) was judged to be LARGER than another distance d(m, n)
    a is counted by iterating over all comparisons of (i, j) with other pairs (m, n).
b is the number of times d(i, j) was judged to be SMALLER than another distance d(m, n), summed over all pairs m, n
