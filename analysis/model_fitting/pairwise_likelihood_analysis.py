"""
In this file, I write methods to calculate the log likelihood of a set of count data given by
geometry of experiments.

If we have data of the form N((i, j) > (k, l)) i.e. number of times (repeats of trials) pair (i, j)
was judged to be more different from the pair (k, l), then we can calculate the log likelihood, LL
as follows:

LL = sum_{over all i,j,k,l} {
    N((i, j) > (k, l)).ln p((i, j) > (k, l))
} + ln Kx
where K is a combinatorial constant that counts the number of orders in which the responses could
have been made.
p is given by our geometry probability using erf.

Note:
If our sigma_point = 0 then the total noise is comprised of two Gaussian sources so erf is fine.
But if sigma_point > 0, then the noise is the square root of a sum of squares of Gaussian distributions plus two
Gaussian distributions, which is not exactly Gaussian. So erf is merely an approximation of the probability,
since it only accounts for Gaussian sources of noise.
